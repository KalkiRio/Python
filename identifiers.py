#it should not be a keyword
# def = 15
# print(def)
#here def is a keyword and will throw an error instead we can use:
Def = 15
print(Def)
#it can be upper case, lowercase or combination of both
NAME="Shatadru"
name="Shatadru R"
Name="Shatadru Roy"
print(NAME,name,Name)
#it should not start with a number
# 2name = "Ribhu"
# print(2name)
#it throws an error as it starts with a number we can instead use numbers in between or at the end
name2="Ribhu"
#we should not use special character except "_" 
# name@1= "Rio"
# print(name@1)
#this throws an error as it contains @ which is a special character instead we can use the one below
name_1="Rio"
print(name_1)
#we should not give space
# uni name="gurugram university"
# print(uni name)
#using space in variable  will give error we can instead use the following:
uni_name="gurugram university"
print(uni_name)
#as per industry standard a variable name should be within 32 characters like the one below which is descriptive but within 32 characters
university_name_and_code = "gurugram university 76399638"
print(university_name_and_code)
