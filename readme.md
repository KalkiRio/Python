# Python Notes with Console-Based Python Projects

Welcome to the **KalkiRio/Python** repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of Python notes, illustrative code snippets, and fully functional console-based Python projects. The repository is designed both as a learning resource for Python beginners and as a reference for more advanced users exploring concepts like data structures, algorithms, OOP, and real-world project implementation.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Python Notes**: Explanations and code samples covering core Python concepts, including data types, variables, strings, inheritance, file handling, and more.
- **Console-Based Projects**: Hands-on projects simulating real-world applications such as e-commerce, banking, travel booking, and more.
- **Practice Problems**: DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) and LeetCode-style problems for logic building.
- **Reference Code**: Pattern programs, API/multithreading prototypes (coming soon), and general-purpose Python code.

The repository is frequently updated and is actively being organized and documented.
