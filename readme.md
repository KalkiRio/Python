# Python Notes with Console Based Python Projects

- Python Notes with console based python projects to help build logics.
- Contains small notes, pattern programs as well as DSA and leetcode problems.
- Frequently updated with content (so don't worry if it looks kinda disorganized it is still being worked on), documentation coming soon.
- Soon to come API and multithreading programs and console projects in the current repository.
- That's about it, hopefully this repo helps people in their journey of learning Python.
