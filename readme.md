Python Notes with console based python projects to help build logics.
Contains small notes, pattern programs as well as DSA and leetcode problems.
Frequently updated with content (so don't worry if it looks kinda disorganized it is still being workd on), documentation coming soon.
Soon to come api and multithreading programs and console projects in the current repository.
That's about it hopefully this repo helps people in their journey of learning python.
